# p5-sketch-template
This template provides the bare bone for getting start with p5.js, also added my
favorite color palette [rose-pine](https://rosepinetheme.com/).

## How to use it?
First you need install [browser-sync](https://browsersync.io/).

After that, `cd` to the root directory of this template, and execute `make` in your command
line shell, this will run the sketch in the browser, and will automatically update
when you save files.
