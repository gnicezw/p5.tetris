# p5-sketch-template
This template provides the bare bone for get start with p5.js, and added my
favorite color scheme (rose-pine) in sketch.js.

## How to use it?
Just `cd` to the root directory of this template, and run `make` in your command
line shell, that is it!

Note: you need install `browser-sync` first.
